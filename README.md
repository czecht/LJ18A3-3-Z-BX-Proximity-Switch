This sketch was created to test my Proximity Switches, including LJ18A3-Z/BX and also LJ12A3-4-ZBX
Before I use one of these switches, I'm testing them with the included sketch for Arduino.
Arduino UNO and at the present time, I'm using Arduino version 1.6.11

The skect has Serial.print command to output the results to a COM port (Serial Monitor)
Please set the com port to 230400 Baud Rate
Resize the COM port to the smallest size 
Turn off the Autoscroll
And set NO LINE ENDING options (right bottom side of the COM port window)
